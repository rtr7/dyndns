# How to Contribute

This project is published primarily as a (functional) tech demo. In case the
project turns out to be useful for others, that’s great!

Corrections and improvements to documentation are welcome. In general,
corrections must pass the existing tests, and any changes which break the
author’s use-case will be reverted.

Please file an issue to get agreement on new features before sending a pull
request.
